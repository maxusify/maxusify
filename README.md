# Welcome, fellow visitor! ðŸ‘‹

My name is MichaÅ‚ - just a curious guy with huge interest in programming and IT in general. Currently, working on some personal projects and learning new stuff!

**What I love:**
- All things related to JavaScript.
- Optimizing stuff, making something more effective and prettier.
- Creating things and care about them.

**Currently gaining knowledge about:**
- Next.js
- Discord.js
- Java
- Rust

**Technologies, programming languages and stuff that I already know:**
- C/C++ (I prefer plain C)
- Python
- JavaScript
- Linux Kernel Modules
- Responsive Web Design

And that's it for now. Still working on properly describing myself... ðŸ˜…
